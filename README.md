# University Management System

The University Management System is a console-based application designed to streamline administrative tasks within a university setting. It provides a comprehensive set of features to manage students, teachers, courses, and the university timetable.

## Features

The system facilitates the registration of new students, where administrators can input the student's full name and identification number. Similarly, new teachers can be registered by providing their full name and identification number.

Creating a new course is made easy with the ability to specify a unique course code, subject name, subject code, and the associated classroom number. This ensures an organized structure for academic offerings.

For effective academic management, the system allows administrators to enroll students in specific courses, enabling them to tailor their academic schedules. Teachers can also be assigned to particular courses, assigning responsibility and facilitating better course management.

Scheduling courses in the university timetable is simplified with the option to input schedules for each day, creating a clear visual representation of the overall university timetable.

Users can easily view the complete university timetable, providing a quick overview of all scheduled courses. Additionally, administrators can retrieve and display a list of students enrolled in a particular course or view the courses in which a specific student is enrolled.

The system follows an intuitive menu-driven interface, providing a seamless user experience for administrators. It also offers an exit option to gracefully conclude interactions with the University Management System.
